                I am a senior at University of Wisconsin - Whitewater. I am striving for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Media Arts and Game Development - Communication/Gaming. I have made the deans list in every semester so far, and I intend
                to keep that streak to the end. <br><br>

                Before I went to college, I was a part of a <b><a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc" style="color: aquamarine;">F.I.R.S.T.</a></b> FRC team called <b style="color: aquamarine;">CORE Robotics</b>. 
                In my time there, I was the lead designer of its website and worked closely with sponsors. Many of my changes and designs are still
                on the website today, and I am proud to be an alumni for such an amazing organization. You can see the website <a href="http://core2062.com/" style="color: aquamarine;"> here</a>! <br><br>

                In my three years in Whitewater thus far, I have worked hard to learn and gain as much experience as possible in the gaming field. I have been a part of a study abroad project (became remote due to Covid 19), personal and team based projects, and 
                numerous game jams during the school years and summers. <br><br>

                I push myself to become better everyday. Making games is my passion, and I hope one day that I can be a part of a great team working for the same goal: to create amazing games that will be cherished by many. <br><br>

                <p>
                    Anima was created during a cooperation with UW Whitewater and HAN University in the Netherlands. 
                    Sadly due to the pandemic, this project had to become remote over the spring and summer. Nonetheless, I still was able to work
                    along side the HAN students from the Netherlands, and we made good use of Jera to organize our project the best we could.<br><br>

                    I was part of one of the two programming teams in Anima. My team focused on the environment mechanics that the player would face. I wrote the code for 
                    pressure plates, door opening, and I also helped with the character programming and bug fixing. Sadly the website to this project was closed, but I 
                    still have access to the files!

                <p>
                    The Watcher was created at the beginning of the Covid 19 Pandemic. Originally made in 48 hours during a local game jam, 
                    The Watcher was published on itch.io, and over the course of a few days it became the top game under the "popular" tag for the survival genre with 
                    thousands of downloads and views with good ratings.<br><br>

                    I was the lead map designer for this project, so my largest job was to create the map and decorate it with foliage and random objects. However, I also
                    participated in programming. I created the note system and helped with level transition.

                <p>
                    Lyra's Tale is my own personal RPG I created over the course of around ten months. I have always wanted to make my own "Zelda" game where 
                    the player embarks on a journey through various maps, slaying monsters, and having a great adventure. <br><br>

                    Every single asset in the game is my own, which includes the art, the story, the programming, and even the music. For the programming, I created
                    my own inventory system, crafting system, input system, combat, dialogue trees, and more. I am very proud of this game even though it is a demo, and I 
                    intend to keep working on this.

                <p>
                    Aroa was created during the Brackey's 2020 game jam, which was a week long. The theme was "rewind," and so we decided to make a game about 
                    time. We came up with the idea to make a horror game placed in a mansion, where there is a large sum of clocks ticking and spinning. 
                    <br><br>
                    I was the lead designer for this game and one of the two programmers. I created the key/door system, the riddle puzzle safe in the basement, all of the
                    player mechanics (such as movement, sprinting, picking up objects), and I made the entire map out of the Unity tool: Probuilder. This Project was
                    awarded an "Honorable Mention" in the 2021 Spring MAGD Expo!
