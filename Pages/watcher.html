            <div class="gameDescription">
                The Watcher is a first-person horror game set in Jackson Forest. There, you find yourself in an abandoned school bus in 
                the middle of no where, yet you feel as though you are being watched. Each night grows more and more restless. Unveil the story
                behind The Watcher, and be careful...you never know if he's standing right behind you.<br><br>

                The Watcher was created during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 during a 48 hour game jam. Inside this jam there were a couple
                of themes to choose from. We ultimately chose the theme "Explore." The group knew that they wanted to create a horror game, so we decided
                to make a game sort of similar to Slender Man, but we added levels. Rather than searching for pieces of paper around the map, each night
                you have one objective which adds on to the narrative. In each night, The Watcher becomes more and more active. This is my most popular
                game on my portfolio. We have thousands of views and downloads thanks to content creators for finding our game.<br><br>

                I was the lead map designer and one of the programmers of this project. I added all of the foliage, the ground textures, the buildings
                 (except for the bus), all of the decorations, and the river.<br><br>

                <br>While not an important mechanic to the overall game, this mechanic added more depth to the story we were 
                attempting to show. The player can pick up certain newspapers similar to in Slender Man, and on the newspapers they can 
                read certain parts of what is happening in the forest. As you can see below, the player is reading one of the various
                newspaper articles hidden throughout the forest.

                <img src = "../Images/separater.png" alt="sep" class = "sep">
                <br>Climbing is a critial mechanic inside of Anima. At times the player will need to complete tasks on their own without the Eagle. Some places
                require the player to climb up a cliff or a wallside. The player may climb those walls by climbing on blue slabs as seen below. I was not the lead
                designer of this mechanic, but I did work closely with the lead designer to program it.

                <img src = "../Images/separater.png" alt="sep" class = "sep">
                <br>Some areas in Anima require a large rock or slab to fall to create a bridge to walk on for both Nio and the Eagle. This mechanic
                allows for either character to push that slab to create the bridge. In the code, I made it so that the map designer can decide either to make
                the slab pushable only by the Eagle, Nio, or both, which allows the map to have interesting functionality. Unfortunately due to time constraints, 
                this mechanic was not used.
