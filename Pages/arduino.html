                Arduino Keyboard Project

                This was my final project for my class Computer Organizations and Systems where I programmed my arduino
                to play and record musical notes. It uses five different buttons that each hold two functions/modes. I can 
                switch between the nodes using a potentiometer. There are eight different notes that can be played, and the other
                two buttons hold the functionality of resetting the song and playing the song back to you.<br><br>

                Our task was to simply create our own project that uses a few tools from our arduino kits. Since I love music, 
                I decided this would be a fun and interesting project to showcase for my class. I also made a video demonstration. <br><br>
