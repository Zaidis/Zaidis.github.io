            </div>
            <div class="gameDescription">
                Faldihr is a single player 2D dungeon crawler game where you play as a lonely wanderer inside a massive cave, known as Faldihr. Many monsters lurk
                within, with a plethora of different treasures for the taking! Be cautious, these monsters are deadly and what nothing of you. Fight for as long as you can!<br><br>

                Faldihr was created during a one month project for my capstone in MAGD 487. It was made in a team of four individuals, and I played a major role in the programming.
                My team decided that we wanted to make a game that had a large scope, and each of us enjoy the dungeon crawler genre. Our biggest inspirations for this game include: 
                Terraria, Dead Cells and Vagante. We also wanted to have a "middle-earth" theme, so in our game we included Dwarves, Kobolds, Goblins and Trolls. Our one constraint
                for this project was that it needed to be something that is not new to us in terms of making games. Therefore, we took mechanics that we made in many of our previous
                projects and incorporated them inside. This game has support for controllers and keyboard/mouse!<br><br>

            <div class="gameDescription">
                I was the lead back-end programmer for Faldihr, however I also had contributions within the player and combat mechanics. I was also the main UI designer, 
                and musician. <br><br>

                <img src = "../Images/separater.png" alt="sep" class = "sep">
                <br>Inside of Faldihr, the player has access to an inventory system that holds onto four different slots. These slots can hold any type of item, whether it be a weapon
                or a consumable such as a health potion. The inventory system has access to several different functions. It can: Add items, Remove items, Drop Items, and Swap Items. Of 
                course, the player can also use their items within this system. As shown below, this system can be seen through the four squares on the bottom left.

                <br>One question that arised was how a player who uses a controller would be able to see their items in the inventory system. I decided to create a way for the player to 
                access their items, as well as see their statistics and the options menu all in one place. Through the menu, the player is able to swap items to different slots. Therefore,
                the player has control over where the items are in their inventory.

                <br>Faldihr has one NPC, known as the Shop Keeper or by his real name, "Bo." This NPC allows the player to purchase items, as well as sell their own items. The player 
                can find the Shop Keeper after each level. Everytime they find the Shop Keeper, Bo will randomly select three items from an item database. One of these items will be the same
                level as the player. The other two items may be any level from the player and below. 
                <br><br>
                Selling items is quite simple as well. The player can sell their items to make some gold in order to purchase other items from the Shop Keeper.

                <img src = "../Images/separater.png" alt="sep" class = "sep">
                <br>Inside of the cave, there is a chance that some chests will spawn inside. There are three tiers for the chests: Wooden, Silver and Gold. Each of these types of chests
                has different items that it could potentially give (the items are random). When the chest opens, it drops an item for the player. Each chest only holds one item.

                    Item Database
                </div>
                <img src = "../Images/separater.png" alt="sep" class = "sep">
                <br>The Item database is quite important inside of the game as it holds each item, as well as its rarity. Each chest, depending on what type it is, will take a random 
                item from one of five random lists, that each holds items. This way the system will know where to look for certain items, as well as making the rarity system more 
                rewarding for the player. 
                <br><br>
                This is also how the Shop Keeper is able to obtain random items, as well as know which item to grab for the exact level. If the player is on level 5 for example, this system 
                will go through the 5th list and randomly select an item inside. 

                <br><br>
                Since Faldihr has a save/load feature, the Item Database also helps with saving the player's inventory.
