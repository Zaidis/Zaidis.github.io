                Lyra's Tale is a 2d top down Role Playing Game where you play as Lyra, a girl who lost her memory from the mysterious dark storm.
                When the Guardians have become tainted by the storm, Lyra must embark on a journey to not only uncover the secrets of her past, 
                but also to save the lands from the Dark Lord Malgorion, who plans to use the Guardians has his puppets!<br><br>

                Lyra's Tale is a passion project of mine that I made during the Spring of 2020 through the Spring of 2021. It is heavily inspired by
                games that I played as a child, mainly The Legend of Zelda. I wanted to make a 2d Role Playing Game where you fight monsters, 
                go through dungeons, and be a part of a narrative. This is the largest game on my portfolio, and every single asset that is inside the game
                was made by myself. That includes the art, the programming, the sound effects, and even the music. <br><br>

                <br>This is arguably one of the most important mechanics in the game. Inside Lyra's Tale, there are many items that you may pick up.
                There are many slots inside of the system, and you can move items from various slots of your choosing. You can also drop items from your
                inventory. Included in this is also the currency system, which is showcased in the inventory. The system also includes gear slots for
                armor and weapons for the player. These slots will increase the player's statistics such as walking speed, damage, etc.

                <br>Crafting items is a large part of most Role Playing Games. In Lyra's Tale, there are two different types of crafting. There is 
                Cooking, and there is Alchemy. Cooking will require the player to find different food materials in order to craft a certain dish. As seen below,
                the player is looking at the recipe for Apple Pie, which requires the player to have at least 3 apples and 1 bread. The Crafting System checks
                the inventory if all items that are required are present. The same goes for Alchemy. <br>

                <br>In Lyra's Tale, you may purchase items from certain NPC's found around the world. Each NPC has their own list of items that they can
                sell, forcing the player to look around to find the NPC that has the items that they need. The player, if they wish, may sell their items
                to the NPCs for a quick source of gold. If the player makes a mistake and sells the wrong item, they can simply go to the "Sold Items" section
                to repurchase the item for the same price that they sold it for.<br>

                <br>There are monsters in Lyra's Tale that will attack the player. Currently, the only monster beyond the boss fight is a slime. Nonetheless, 
                the player will need to defeat these monsters, or else the player will lose health. If the player is holding a sword in the sword slot, the player
                may then swing the sword in front of them, dealing damage to all monsters nearby in front of the player. The player may also use a shield
                to block the monster's damage.<br><br>

                If a monster is slain, it will drop a random amount of gold on the ground for the player to pick up. In some cases, the player needs to defeat
                all the monsters in a room in order to proceed to the next area.

                <br>In Lyra's Tale, if the player wishes, they may save their current game to pick it up later. This will save the player's location, 
                inventory, quests completed, and currency. This creates a binary file in the game folder which can be looked at when loading the game later on. 
                This will also save the items in the inventory system in the slots that they were in previously. <br><br>In order to save the game, the player
                will need to find a statue as shown below. In order to load the game, simply start the game and select "Load Game."<br>
