                This was my final project for my class COMPSCI 366 - Database Management Systems. We were tasked with taking a 
                dataset from any source and creating a system that allowed any user to search with different queries through SQL. My 
                group was filled with game developers, so we decided to find a dataset filled with different titles and various 
                information for each one, such as the year it was released, the developer, its genre, etc. There are over 16,000 entries.   <br><br>

                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arslanali4343/sales-of-video-games?resource=download" style=" color: aquamarine;" target="_blank">Here is the dataset</a>
                <br><br>

                We needed to create at least 12 different search queries with hard-coded SQL statements. Within those 12 queries, we needed 
                at least 3 stored procedures. My group decided to create a custom GUI for the user to search the database with using Java. We are holding
                the dataset information using my University's server. <br><br>
                
                
                Software Used: Eclipse, pUTTY<br>
                Languages: Java, SQL <br>
                Status: Complete<br><br>
