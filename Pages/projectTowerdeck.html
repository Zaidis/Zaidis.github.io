                Project: TOWERDECK is a deck-builder, tower defense, rogue-like game where the player utilizes a growing deck of cards
                to defend their castle from an endless onslaught of horrifying monsters in a procedurally generated dark cave! Choose between
                four unique classes or multiclass! Specialize more into placing towers or more into casting spells! Battle against terrifying
                bosses and push your way to the dungeon! <br><br>

                As a fan of both tower defense games and strategy card games, I decided to take it upon myself to combine the two massive genres.
                The idea was to make a game in a fantasy RPG setting where it felt like you were playing a card game such as Slay the Spire, but the 
                avenue of which you play on was on a procedurally generated map and you are playing against the AI enemies. 
                
                The game is not yet finished, however I made this section to explain the game thoroughly through a few massive systems.

                    Map Generation
                </div>
                <img src = "../Images/separater.png" alt="sep" class = "sep">
                <br>Project: TOWERDECK has a procedurally generated map that is created before the game begins. Each chunk of the map is called a "Map Block," 
                and with these map blocks I am able to build a map that enemies can walk across and move toward the player's castle. <br><br>
                
                There is a map block for every combination of directions within a square. That includes north, south, east, and west. As an example, there is a map block
                for just north, and there is one for the combination of north, south, and east. An example below: <br><br>

                There are several steps to ensure the game will run smoothly. 
                <img src = "../Images/towerdeck/1.PNG" alt="sep" class = " headerImage"><br><br>
                <span>Step 1: Initial generation of the map. </span><br><br>

                A castle mapblock is placed. When any mapblock is placed, all open directions that it provides is placed in a list. It is this list that I 
                pull a new location from to place a new mapblock. A loop runs through this a number of times equal to the amount that I set (lets say 100 mapblocks
                for example). <br><br>

                This step is crucial as it places the foundation of the map. When placing any block, I must check to ensure that the direction it came from is connected
                to the new block. If I place a block at (0, 1) and it came from (0, 0), then the new block must connect with its southern neighbour. <br><br>

                <span>Step 2: Smoothing the edges. </span><br><br>

                After the initial generation, I go through every block to make sure that it doesn't have open directions. We don't want to have a mapblock open
                to the endless void where nothing is, it should be closed off. Should I find something that is "broken," I simply replace a block with a suitable
                block. If I replace a block that has an open path going east, I just replace it with a block that cannot go east. <br><br>

                <span>Step 3: Waypoint Generation/Connecting </span><br><br>

                Waypoints are my term for transform locations that enemies (or projectiles) use to walk toward. Part of placing a block is to connect all neighbours
                via their Waypoints. I do this in a separate step to ensure a smooth transition from generating the map and replacing any blocks that I come across.<br><br>
                
                Enemy AI should have its own section but I figured I would put this here as it is part of my overall map generation. In the picture above, the Waypoints
                are the pink dots. <br><br>

                    Card Mechanics

                <img src = "../Images/separater.png" alt="sep" class = "sep"><br>

                Project: TOWERDECK utilizes cards as its main way of involving strategic gameplay for the players. Cards are what places new towers, 
                casts spells onto the map that could damage enemies or upgrade towers, or cast spells that could give you more opportunities of finding 
                new cards by drawing more, finding a specific one, etc. <br><br>

                As someone who has played many card games, I knew that there was a certain feel that I wanted for my card game. The best part of any major 
                card game is the amount of ways you can play it. No two games are the same. The way I accomplish this is by having the player choose a class!<br><br>

                Players may choose to be a wizard, bard, cleric, or ranger (for now). Each class comes with their own unique cards and card mechanics that players 
                may choose from over the course of their time playing. They are even allowed, after a certain amount of waves, to multiclass and mix the 
                type of cards they have to choose from! So, if you wanted to be a ranger-wizard, you could. <br><br>

                <i>The green card below is a Ranger card. Only rangers can place a Sniper Tower!</i>
